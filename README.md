# Expeditions

## Background

Expeditions will be a single-page app that features a circle packing map filtered by continent, country, and experience. As you interact with the map you can highlight various places or experiences you are interested to learn more about the types of travel experiences and locations you are interested in exploring.

## Functionality & MVP

With Expeditions, users will be able to:

1. See a circle packing map of experiences to explore
2. Click on locations to view a modal with information and travel advice
3. Outline locations they are interested in exploring further on the circle map
4. Change the map color based on experiences they like to see a circle packing map of their interests 

This project will also include:

1. A modal describing the project and the developer
2. A production README

## Technologies

Expeditions will use:

1. JavaScript, HTML, CSS
2. D3 to create circle packing map visualization

## Implementation Timeline

#### Day 1
* Get site up and running
* Set up a D3 map with a default view

#### Day 2
* Allow D3 map to handle various data input
* Make map clickable

#### Day 3
* Input experience data sets and begin styling

#### Day 4
* Focus on styling and make styling editable by user so they can mark their interests

## Bonus Feature

Allow user to change the mapping from location based to experience type. Instead of experiencing the map from global -> continent -> country -> experience they could select to view from type of experience (adventure, urban, etc) -> country -> experience. This would add addtional interaction for explorers who know more about the types of experiences they are looking for.
