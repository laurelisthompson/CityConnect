## Background

Data Correlator will be a single-page app that features a circle packing graph filtered by continent and country. You can explore the loaded datasets through the interactive graph and learn more about how countries vary by area, population, and GDP and the ways these correlate with each other.

## Functionality & MVP

With Expeditions, users will be able to:

1. See a circle packing map of experiences to explore
2. Interact with the circle packing graph through clicking on circles
3. Select different circle packing graphs to compare

This project will also include:

1. A modal describing the project and the developer
2. A production README

## Technologies

Expeditions will use:

1. JavaScript, HTML, CSS
2. D3 to create circle packing graph visualization
