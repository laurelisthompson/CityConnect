It’s time to explore the world’s data! Data Correlator allows comparison and interaction with data order to gain a
deeper understanding of its impact. The data sets used compare area (in km²), GDP (in the international dollar), and
population for countries around the world, along with the cities in the word that have populations exceeding 1 million
people.

## Background

Data Correlator will be a single-page app that features a circle packing graph filtered by continent and country. You can explore the loaded datasets through the interactive graph and learn more about how countries vary by area, population, and GDP and the ways these correlate with each other.

## Functionality & MVP

With Data Correlator, users will be able to:

1. See a circle packing map of experiences to explore
2. Interact with the circle packing graph with your mouse
3. Select different circle packing graphs to compare

This project will also include:

1. A modal describing the project and the developer
2. A production README

## Technologies

Data Correlator will use:

1. JavaScript, HTML, CSS
2. D3.js library to create circle packing graph visualization
